# CS155miniproject1

#TL;DR
An ensemble model created to tackle a machine learning challenge hosted on Kaggle as part of the Caltech CS155 course.


Competition Overview:

Customer retention is a vital aspect of any successful business model, whether it's a streaming platform or a clothing store. Knowing whether a customer will continue to use a service is crucial for companies to tailor their strategies effectively. In this competition, participants are tasked with predicting whether a customer will discontinue service based on demographic and company-related features.

Dataset:

Participants will be provided with data from a telecom company that includes information on customers who have discontinued the service in previous months. The dataset includes demographic features as well as company-related features such as types of services purchased. Additional data sources are not allowed for this competition.

Competition Details:

Platform: Kaggle
Submission Limit: 10 submissions per day per team
Submission Deadline: Friday, February 9th, at 5:00 PM PST
Data Usage: Use the training data (train.csv) to make predictions for the test data (test.csv).
Performance Evaluation: A public leaderboard will be provided to help participants estimate their model's performance on the public test set. The leaderboard ranking on the private test set will be revealed at the end of the competition.
Benchmark: TAs will provide a benchmark submission, and participants are encouraged to surpass it.


With my team, I developed an ensemble model that incorporates XGBoost, neural networks, LightGBM, and AutoGluon.
